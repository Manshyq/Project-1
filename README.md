## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Meta content(content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0") -For proper size
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (Wrapper)
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Google Fonts]("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap");- For Font


### What I learned
We have learned how to combine JavaScript, HTML and CSS in one project. 
Also we have gained a lot of knowledge and practice in programming while doing this project.

```html
<div class="wrapper"></div> -For wrappers
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="favicon-32x32.png"> - For Icon before Title
<div class="accordion__wrapper"></div> - For hidden content
```
```css

@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@400;700&display=swap");  -For Importing Google Fonts
:root {
  --softRed: hsl(14, 88%, 65%);
  --veryDarkGrayBlue: hsl(237, 12%, 33%);
  --darkGrayBlue: hsl(240, 6%, 50%);
  --lightGrayBlue: hsl(240, 5%, 91%);
  --fontSize: 12px;                            - Pseudo-Class that matches the root element of a tree representing the document
}

*,
*:before,
*:after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}                                           -Selectors for inserting something before and after the selected content



```
```js
this.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () =>{ -For adding the function
}
```

### Continued development

We would like to focus more on JavaScript to make the website more flexible for the users.
### Useful resources
